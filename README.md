# Pandora Launcher

Work in progress

## Command line

- `pandora --run-instance "Instance name"` opens the launcher and starts the named instance with full asset verification. This remains the behavior used by existing instance shortcuts.
- `pandora --run-instance-normal "Instance name"` opens the launcher and starts the named instance with the same asset verification mode as the GUI **Start** button. Use this explicit option when automating a normal launcher start.

The two launch options cannot be combined. Without either option, Pandora only opens or focuses its main window.

The private launcher starts from the instance's existing `.minecraft` directory and keeps it writable across runs. Start does not rotate or rebuild `mods/`; the private updater must install pack changes into the instance before launch. The former `original_mods` layout is restored only when migrating an instance left by an older launcher build. Third-party Modrinth/CurseForge modpack expansion is not part of this private Start path.

## FAQ

### Discord Server

https://pandora.moulberry.com/discord

### Where can I suggest a feature/report a bug?

Please use GitHub issues.

### Why should I use Pandora over other launchers?

1. If you like one of the features above
2. If you like the general design/ux of the launcher, personally I find it very easy to use
3. The launcher is designed to be performant, from storage space to cpu and memory usage

### Will Pandora be monetized?

Unlikely, for a few reasons:
- I believe that it is wrong for launchers to be monetized without distributing revenue back to mod creators that give the launcher value in the first place. Since I don't have the infrastructure to be able to redistribute revenue to mod creators, this is a big barrier.
- Dealing with monetization takes a lot of (ongoing) work, probably more work than creating the launcher itself.
- I personally dislike advertisements.
